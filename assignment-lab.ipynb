    "## Looking at OpenMP Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the assembly for OpenMP programs, you'll find that your loop body has been replaced with a function call.  OpenMP does this so it can tell it's worker threads to call the function to perform one iteration of your loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats for our Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "First, `gprof` doesn't work on with multi-threaded programs.  You can use it for single-threaded runs, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, Moneta's cache model is not multithread-aware, so the cache hit/miss numbers for multithreaded programs are not meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moneta may also show more threads that you might be expecting.  OpenMP threads seem to be Thread 0 and 13 and above.  If you see some threads that don't seem to be doing anything, that's not surprising or concerning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our performance counting code only collects data for one thread.  For OpenMP code this is ok:  all the threads do basically the same thing.  But you'll notice, for instance, that if a loop runs in 4 threads, the measure instruction count will go down by ~1/4 (assuming multi-threading didn't add a lot of overhead).\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "## Controlling the Number of Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "By default the autograder will run your code with 12 threads.  If you want to use a different number in your final run, you can call \n",

    "omp_set_num_threads(thread_count);\n",

    "## Things To Try\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Deterministic Tests (New for Assignment 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "With threading, comes non-deterministic bugs.  This means that the tests may fail only occasionally for your code.  If this seems to be happening, a good strategy is to just run them repeatedly and confirm that it's the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not a bug in the benchmark, you have a thread synchronization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Tips (New for Assignment 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples we saw that loop tiling and OpenMP pragmas can work well together.  This carries through to how you should figure out what to parallelize.  It's worth your time to try parallelizing different loops and changing how your loops are nested to accommodate that.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Use `ET` to guide your optimizations.\n",
    "1.  At this points you have many tools avaiassignmentle to you -- `omp parallel for`, `omp simd`, compiler optimizations, tiling.  The number of combinations is enormous.   I suggest applying them in this order (from largest impact-per-effort to smallest):\n",
    "    1.  Get last assignment into good shape (see notes above and slides from class)\n",
    "    2.  `omp parallel for`\n",
    "    3.  `omp simd`\n",
    "    4.  Fiddling with other compiler options/per-function compiler options.\n",
    "    5.  Crazy stuff like intrinsics for better SIMD performance.\n",
    "1.  While tiling only applied to loops with reuse (because temporal locality requires reuse), `parallel for` can apply to loops without reuse.  Same for `omp simd`.\n",
    "2.  `omp parallel for` implicitly does tiling, since it divides the iterations of the parallel loop across several cores.\n",
    "1.  Nesting parallel for loops with OpenMP is not usually a good idea (although it should work).  Start by picking one loop to parallelize.\n",
    "2.  You want to parallelize an outer loop, so that the threads are working on large pieces of computation and need to synchronize less.\n",
    "3.  Pay close attention to whether iterations of your parallel loop are writing to the same locations.  If so, you'll need a `omp critical` to ensure correct updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last point can be tricky.  If I have this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#pragma omp parallel for\n",
    "for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n",
    "    for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {\n",
    "        for(int k = 0; k < 10; k++) {\n",
    "            X[i][j] += Y[k][j];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The only store is the assignment to `X(i, j)`.  Since `i` is the index of the parallel loop, I know that no other thread will be updating `X(i,j)`, since no other thread will have the same value of `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#pragma omp parallel for\n",
    "for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n",
    "    for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {\n",
    "        for(int k = 0; k < 10; k++) {\n",
    "            X[k][j] += Y[i][j];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't have the same guarantee.  Since `i` does is not used to select an element in `X`, every other thread will write to that location as well.  In that case, I could do\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#pragma omp parallel for\n",
    "for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n",
    "    for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {\n",
    "        for(int k = 0; k < 10; k++) {\n",
    "#pragma omp critical\n",
    "            X[k][j] += Y[i][j];\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which will probably be really slow, or I could create a private tensor, do my updates there, and then merge them into `X`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Pay close attention to write sharing when you are deciding how to parallelize.  Can the iterations of your parallel loop iterations write to the same place?\n",
    "4.  `omp simd` only works on inner loops.\n",
    "5.  `omp parallel for` works best on outer loops.\n",
    "7.  `gprof` doesn't work for multithreading, so use `ET` to measure how long things take.\n"

    "### Useful C++ ( Partly New For Assignment 5) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Controlling Compiler Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can prevent inlining of a particular function by declaring it like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "void __attribute__((noinline)) join_solution(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This can make it easier to debug, because you can set a breakpoint on the function and it'll work like you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, you can turn on arbitrary optimizations for particular functions like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#pragma GCC push_options\n",
    "#pragma GCC optimize (\"unroll-loops\")\n",
    "\n",
    "void your_function() {\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "#pragma GCC pop_options\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "The `assert()` macro is useful tool for debugging and to avoid silly errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you say\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "assert(a > b);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And the expression is not true at run time, the assert with \"fail\" your program will crash with a somewhat useful error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a useful way to document and enforce assumptions you make in your code.  For instance, I used an assert in `convolution_tiled_split()` to ensure that the tile size was > 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get access to  `assert()` with \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#include<cassert>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The overhead of asserts is low, but not zero.  I would not put any in one of your performance-critical loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to include asserts in performance-critical areas, you can add `-DNDEBUG` to the optimizations in `config.make`.  It'll disable all the `assert()`s.\n",

    "This assignment completes our tour of (single processor) memory systems.  It explored what's required to exploit temporal locality and when it does and does not exist.  It also looked at other key components of the memory hierarchy:  The lower-level caches and the TLB.   Finally, it developed an optimized version of 1-D convolution using tiling and renesting, and you got to apply those concepts to markov queries, one of the most crtical SQL operators, in databases.  You should now be well-prepared for the next assignment, where we will explore (among other things) how multiple processors further-complicate the performance of the memory hierarchy."
